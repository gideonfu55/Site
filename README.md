# Learning to Learn

Project based on Learning to Learn Coursera Course

Purpose of this project is to apply the JS skills I've learnt to building a carousel web component.

The topics presented in this project is based on the lessons I've learnt in a coursera course - Learning How to Learn by Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski.

I have benefited from this course immensely and hope to apply some of these lessons in my web development learning journey.
