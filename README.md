# Learning to Learn

Project based on Learning to Learn Coursera Course

Purpose of this project is to apply the JS skills I've learnt to building a carousel web component.

The topics presented in this project is based on the lessons I've learnt in a coursera course - Learning How to Learn by Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski.

I have benefited from this course immensely and hope to apply some of these lessons in my web development learning journey.

Cheers!

Side note: Refreshing the page when viewing the first time on landscape mode in mobiles will set the viewport correctly and provide the proper page when alternating between portrait and landscape views. Not sure why as of now.
